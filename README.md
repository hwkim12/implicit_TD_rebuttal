# Implicit Temporal Difference Learning

This repository is dedicated to demonstrate the effectiveness of implicit TD algorithms in 1) an 11-state random walk with two absorbing end points, 2) a synthetic 100-dimensional MRP, and 3) classical continuous domain control problems: Acrobot and Mountain Car environments.


Please see IMPLICIT_TD_REBUTTAL.pdf for the description of the plots provided in this repository.
